# Part 3.
# Build a simple perceptron with a step activation function. The perceptron should take the color histogram as its input and return a single output: 1 if aurora is in the image and 0 otherwise. You can implement this logic by simple checking the perceptronâ€™s output, if the output is high return true, otherwise return false. When you are training the perceptron split the feature vectors into 80% of images for training and reserve 20% for validation. When training the perceptron, present the color histograms at random. Test different batch sizes (20 would be a good start).

# Make sure your perceptron implementation has a parameterized learning rate. Perform experiments with the learning m = 0.1, 0.01, 0.001, and 1.5. Run as many learning batches/epochs as you need to achieve desired classification performance. For your report, one of your figures should include a plot of a training error and classification accuracy (two plot curves) vs. training epoch. You might also want to include accuracy, precision, recall measures for your experiments.
